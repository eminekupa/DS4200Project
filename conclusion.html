          <h3 class="mb-4">From Channels to Customers: A Journey Through Cancellations</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            This project began with a simple question: why do hotel bookings get canceled? Over the course of the semester, we examined this question through the lens of over 22,000 bookings across Spain, France, and Italy â€” three tourism-driven Mediterranean economies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our visualization story follows a deliberate narrative arc that progressively deepens the analysis: starting with how people book (channels), moving to who they are (repeat vs. new guests), where they're booking (geographic context), what drives their decisions (pricing and demographics), and ultimately which market segments they belong to. This progression allows us to uncover the multifaceted nature of cancellation behaviors across the Mediterranean region.

              <ul>
                <li>Direct/Corporate bookings: lowest cancellation rates (~8%)</li>

            By understanding these cancellation patterns, our visualization story provides insights that hotel managers can use to better predict booking reliability, improve revenue forecasting, and develop targeted retention strategies for the Mediterranean market. Our progression from booking channels to customer segments creates a comprehensive view of what drives cancellation behaviors.

          <h3 class="mb-4">Final Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Our analysis reveals that cancellation behaviors in Mediterranean hotels are influenced by multiple interconnected factors. Booking channels significantly impact reliability, with direct bookings proving most stable. Customer loyalty emerges as perhaps the strongest predictor of booking commitment, with repeat guests consistently showing lower cancellation rates. Geographic and seasonal patterns vary considerably, with city hotels and business travelers demonstrating higher cancellation tendencies than resort and leisure bookings. Demographic analysis shows couples are surprisingly more likely to cancel than other traveler types. Finally, our market segmentation uncovers specific high-risk combinations like Online TA/Transient customers that require targeted retention strategies. These findings provide hotel managers with actionable insights to develop differentiated pricing, overbooking policies, and marketing strategies tailored to each segment's distinct cancellation risk profile.
