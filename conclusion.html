          <p class="lead">
            This project began with a simple question: why do hotel bookings get canceled? Over the course of the semester, we examined this question through the lens of over 22,000 bookings across Spain, France, and Italy â€” three tourism-driven Mediterranean economies.

          <h3 class="mb-4">Final Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Through this project, we uncovered several key drivers of booking cancellations in Mediterranean hotels. We found that bookings made through third-party channels are significantly more prone to cancellation than direct bookings. Repeat guests are far more likely to follow through with their reservations, especially during high-demand periods, highlighting the importance of loyalty. Demographic factors also played a critical role with families with young children being much more likely to cancel compared to solo travelers or couples. Our market segmentation analysis added another layer, revealing that certain guest types and contract types are consistently more reliable than others. These findings emphasize the need for hotels to tailor their booking strategies, cancellation policies, and customer engagement efforts based on both how and who is booking. Overall, our work demonstrates how structured data analysis and visualization can uncover practical insights that directly inform operational decision-making in the hospitality industry.
