          <p class="lead">
            Our semester-long project explored the nuanced patterns behind hotel booking cancellations across Spain, France, and Italy. By combining diverse visualization techniques and filtering our data through multiple dimensions — such as booking source, guest loyalty, geography, demographics, and market segmentation — we uncovered key trends that can guide better decision-making in the hospitality sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            We found that bookings made through Travel Agents and Online Travel Agencies are significantly more likely to be canceled than those made directly, a finding supported by our static D3 bar chart. This highlights a critical area where hotels can improve reliability by incentivizing direct bookings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our interactive Plotly line chart showed that repeat guests cancel far less frequently than new ones, underscoring the business value of loyalty. Meanwhile, geographic analysis revealed distinct differences between city and resort hotels — a reflection of shifting guest intentions across regions and seasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Altair-based demographic visualization demonstrated that families (especially those traveling with babies or children) cancel more often than couples or solo travelers. These trends suggest operational flexibility and marketing strategies should vary depending on guest type.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, our market segmentation heatmap revealed deeper patterns in cancellation behavior across customer types and booking purposes, providing useful takeaways for revenue management and guest targeting.

          <h3 class="mb-4">Future Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            With more time and resources, future work could include integrating price sensitivity, customer satisfaction scores, or seasonality-adjusted demand forecasts. Additional visualizations — such as interactive Sankey diagrams or machine learning-based risk predictions — could help better capture the complexity of hotel cancellations in a globalized tourism landscape.

            Ultimately, this project highlights the power of thoughtful data cleaning, meaningful visual storytelling, and collaborative analysis. Through our work, we demonstrated how data-driven insights can support operational efficiency, customer engagement, and strategic planning across Mediterranean hotel markets.
