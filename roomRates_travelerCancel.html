    <h2>General Instructions for Interactive Plot</h2>
    <p>
        For the following, you can select a specific interval for the Line Plot's monthly 
    date range. Select and drag this interval to whichever point you prefer. The changes will
    be updated automatically in the Bar Plot, so you'll be able to see which types of travellers
    were most likely to cancel their bookings/reservations within that timeframe.

    <h2>Analysis of the Interactive Line & Bar Plot:
    </h2>
    <p>
            Based on the interactive visualization above, one could see that it's a joint graph between a 
        line and bar plot. The reasoning behind this is to provide accurate insights behind what might be driving 
        cancellation rates in hotels in Spain, Italy, and France - we can determine exploratory and explanatory insights 
        from this visualization. The line plot measures average room rates respective to a specific month and year; for 
        these values, the Average Daily Room Rate has been aggregated from a daily to a monthly rate, which maintains 
        consistency with the date (independent variable). As for the specific trends that we can see, this relationship 
        has been designated by the specific country the hotels pertain to. For example, we see a similar, potentially cyclical 
        trend, that might hint at seasonality between the Summer and Winter months. It looks like that the room rates are at 
        elevated values for Summer months, which suggests that demand might be higher during these months, due to factors like 
        tourism. On a per country basis, it is hard to make a determinable conclusion other than the fact that Spain has had the 
        highest Summer monthly rates (2016 & 2017) whereas they had the lowest Winter monthly rates (2015) and France also had the 
        lowest (2017).
            As for the bar plot, this analysis is between traveler type and the percentage of cancellations respective to that 
        type. Our motive to include this graph was to be able to understand, at specific periods, which types of travelers were 
        cancelling reservations more so than the other groups. This plot updates per the selection interval the user makes in the 
        line plot. Overall, though, we can clearly see that an overwhelming majority of cancellations stem from the "couple" traveler 
        type. This is an interesting factor because it is at 70%, which is ~60% higher than the next respective type (family). This 
        possibly suggests that couples have more freedom to move hotel bookings or a higher incentive to look for bargains and, 
        therefore, cancel bookings that are too expensive/not worth it. This also suggests that, for the other types, it might be 
        too difficult for families or solo travelers to cancel bookings: families typically have a lot of responsibilities and solo 
        travelers might be highly correlated with business travel.
